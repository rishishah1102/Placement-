The java development kit is required to java programs. The jdk is the software which allows the programmer to develop the java program.

What is jdk?
-> The jdk is java development kit which contain the tools and jre.

Why we use jdk?
-> We use jdk to develop java program.

How to use jdk?
-> To use jdk we need to set path of bin in environment variables and then type javac in command prompt.

What is jre?
-> The jre is the Java Runtime Environment which contain the libraries and jvm.

Why we use jre?
-> We use jre to run java code on our device.

How to use jre?
-> When you run your java code the jre is run.

What is jvm?
The java virtual machine is the machine that executes the java code.

Why we use jvm?
-> We use jvm to verify and executes the java bytecode.

How is the code run in java?
-> The code is run in two steps :-
   1- Compilation :- It is process in which our java-source-code[whose extension is .java] is converted into bytecode[whose extension is .class]. The java source is converted by the compiler which resides inside the jdk.

   2- Execution :- It is the process in which our java bytecode[.class] is converted into machine language i.e. in binary form. The jvm takes the bytecode and converts it into binary form.

The main function is the function by which our program execution starts. The void means null[khali/empty].

The unary operators are those operators who performs the operation in only one operand.

The binary operators are those operators who performs the operation between two operands.
